[Transducers](http://clojure.org/transducers) are composable algorithmic transformations. They are independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation in terms of an individual element. Because transducers are decoupled from input or output sources, they can be used in many different processes - collections, streams, channels, observables, etc. Transducers compose directly, without awareness of input or creation of intermediate aggregates.

## Usage

* [API Docs](http://cognitect-labs.github.io/transducers-java)

The `Fns` class in the `com.cognitect.transducers` package provide the available transducing functionality.  To use this library, simple import the package as such:

```java
import static com.cognitect.transducers.Fns.*;
```

All of the methods on the `Fns` class are static.

### Transducing functions

A Transducer transforms a reducing function of one type into a reducing function of another (possibly the same) type.  For the sake of illustration, you can define an `com.cognitect.transducers.ITransducer` mapping instance that encapsulates an operation that takes `Long`s and converts them into `String`s:

```java
ITransducer<String, Long> stringify = map(new Function<Long, String>() {
    @Override
    public String apply(Long i) {
        return i.toString();
    }
});
```

Because Transducers are agnostic to both the source of their inputs and the target of their intermediate sub-processes, you need a way to independently supply these elements for the purpose of executing an operation.  The specification of the intermediate stages is given by creating an instance of an `com.cognitect.transducers.IStepFunction`, shown below:

```java
IStepFunction<List<String>, String> addString = new IStepFunction<List<String>, String>() {
    @Override
    public List<String> apply(List<String> result, String input, AtomicBoolean reduced) {
        result.add(input);
        return result;
    }
};
```

The `addString` function supplies the knowledge of how to accumulate the result of an operation.  In this case, `addString` accepts a list and a `String` instance and adds it to the end of the list.  One of the most common ways to apply transducers is with the `com.cognitect.transducers.Fns#transduce` method, which is analogous to a standard `reduce` or `foldl` function found in many functional programming languages.  Given the Transducer `stringify` and the step function `addString`, you can initiate the mapping process by simply providing an `ArrayList<String>` instance serving as the output target for the step function and a list of `Longs` serving as the source of data for the whole operation:

```java
transduce(stringify, addString, new ArrayList<String>(), longs(10));

//=> ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
```

The `longs` method is a convenience (not shown here) that returns a list of `Long` instances.

### Composing transducers

Transducers are composable, allowing you to define aggregate processes from parts.  To show this, you can define a Transducer named `filterOdds` that is meant to identify odd numbered `Longs` via the results of a `com.cognitect.transducers.Predicate` instance:

```java
ITransducer<Long, Long> filterOdds = filter(new Predicate<Long>() {
    @Override
    public boolean test(Long num) {
        return num.longValue() % 2 != 0;
    }
});			
```

Transducers are composed using the `com.cognitect.transducers.Fns#compose` method:

```java
ITransducer<String, Long> stringifyOdds = filterOdds.comp(stringify);
```

The transducer `stringifyOdds` is a transformation stack that will be applied by a process to a series of input elements:

```java
transduce(stringifyOdds, addString, new ArrayList<String>(), longs(10));

//=> ["1", "3", "5", "7", "9"]
```

For more examples of using Transducers, you can view the [transducers-java JavaDocs](http://cognitect-labs.github.io/transducers-java/) and the `com.cognitect.transducers.Fns` [test suite](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-java/blob/master/src/test/com/cognitect/transducers/FnsTest.java).
